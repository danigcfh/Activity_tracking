## Activity Tracking Scripts

### Description
This repository contains three R scripts designed for tracking daily activities and analytics, including difficulty, mood, sleep, and exercise, to help analyze personal productivity and well-being.
It's a personal initiative to track my daily activities, mood and how these things interact

### Files
1. **`Create_Files.R`**  
   Creates two Excel files:
   - `Activities.xlsx`: Tracks individual activities and their attributes.
   - `Day_Analytics.xlsx`: Summarizes daily metrics.
   
2. **`Add_Activity.R`**  
   Updates `Activities.xlsx` by appending new rows for daily activities.

3. **`Daily_Analytics.R`**  
   Processes the data in `Activities.xlsx` to calculate daily metrics, including:
   - Number of activities
   - Weighted difficulty based on activity, mood, and sleep. With the current parameters, the ideal range for daily weighted difficulty would be a score of around 20-30 to ensure a manageable balance between productivity and well-being.
   - Summary of anxiety, mood, and exercise metrics.

### Usage
1. **Setup**
   - Run `Create_Files.R` first to initialize the Excel files.
   - Customize column values based on your needs.

2. **Adding Activities**
   - Use `Add_Activity.R` to input daily activities. Update the `row` section with relevant data:
     ```R
     row <- data.frame(
       Day = Sys.Date(),
       Topic = "Example Topic",
       Activity = "Example Activity",
       Difficulty = 3,
       Sub_category_1 = "Example Subcategory",
       Sub_category_2 = "Optional",
       Sleep = NA, Anxiety = NA, Mood = NA, Comment = NA
     )
     ```

3. **Daily Analytics**
   - Run `Daily_Analytics.R` to calculate daily summaries and export the updated `Day_Analytics.xlsx`.
   - The weighted metric takes into account mood, sleep, number of activities and their difficulties

This is an ongoing project. It will probably be updated for weekly and monthly summaries in the future.
