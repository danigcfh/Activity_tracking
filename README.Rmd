## Activity Tracking Scripts

### Description
This repository contains three R scripts designed for tracking daily activities and analytics, including difficulty, mood, sleep, and exercise, to help analyze personal productivity and well-being.

### Files
1. **`Create_Files.R`**  
   Creates two Excel files:
   - `Activities.xlsx`: Tracks individual activities and their attributes.
   - `Day_Analytics.xlsx`: Summarizes daily metrics.
   
2. **`Add_Activity.R`**  
   Updates `Activities.xlsx` by appending new rows for daily activities.

3. **`Daily_Analytics.R`**  
   Processes the data in `Activities.xlsx` to calculate daily metrics, including:
   - Number of activities
   - Weighted difficulty based on activity, mood, and sleep
   - Summary of anxiety, mood, and exercise metrics.

### Usage
1. **Setup**
   - Run `Create_Files.R` first to initialize the Excel files.
   - Customize column values based on your needs.

2. **Adding Activities**
   - Use `Add_Activity.R` to input daily activities. Update the `row` section with relevant data:
     ```R
     row <- data.frame(
       Day = Sys.Date(),
       Topic = "Example Topic",
       Activity = "Example Activity",
       Difficulty = 3,
       Sub_category_1 = "Example Subcategory",
       Sub_category_2 = "Optional",
       Sleep = NA, Anxiety = NA, Mood = NA, Comment = NA
     )
     ```

3. **Daily Analytics**
   - Run `Daily_Analytics.R` to calculate daily summaries and export the updated `Day_Analytics.xlsx`.

This is an ongoing project. It will probably be updated for weekly and monthly summaries in the future.
